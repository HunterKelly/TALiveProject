# TALiveProject
This is the source code I created while working on The Tech Academy Live Project. For the last two weeks of my time at the tech academy, I worked with my peers in a team developing a full scale MVC/MVVM Web Application in C#. Working on a legacy codebase was a great learning oppertunity for fixing bugs, cleaning up code, and adding requested features.
