# TALiveProject
This is the source code I created while working on The Tech Academy Live Project. For the last two weeks of my time at the tech academy, I worked with my peers in a team developing a full scale MVC/MVVM Web Application in C#. Working on a legacy codebase was a great learning oppertunity for fixing bugs, cleaning up code, and adding requested features.

Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on, along with code snippets

Back End Stories: <br>
Created CRUD application for production members. An admin can add or remove production members to a table in the database. The photos on the table are converted to byte format for easy storage and retrieval




Front End Stories
On the index page, they are organized by which production they work on.
